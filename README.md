# gha-workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for the **innovspatial** estate.

## Workflows

### `dokploy-custom-app.yml`

Build, push, deploy, and verify a custom app via Dokploy + Tailscale + Traefik.

**Caller pattern** (in each app repo's `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

# Required: grant the reusable workflow the permissions it needs.
# Caller MUST grant these — caller's grant is the upper bound for the
# reusable workflow. Without these, the run fails with startup_failure.
permissions:
  contents: read    # actions/checkout
  packages: write   # docker push to GHCR

jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: hemanth1986/gha-workflows/.github/workflows/dokploy-custom-app.yml@main
    with:
      app_host: biometric.innovspatial.app
      ghcr_image: ghcr.io/hemanth1986/biometric-sync
    secrets: inherit
```

**Required secrets in caller repo:**

| Secret | Source |
|---|---|
| `DOKPLOY_API_TOKEN` | global Dokploy API key (see `Infra/Vault/Secrets.md`) |
| `DOKPLOY_COMPOSE_ID` | per-app compose ID |
| `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Tailscale OAuth client (`tag:ci`) |
| `TS_OAUTH_SECRET` | Tailscale OAuth secret |

**`/ready` endpoint contract** — every custom app MUST implement:

```
GET /ready  ->  200 JSON
{
  "status": "ready",
  "version": "<from package.json>",
  "revision": "<APP_REVISION env, baked at build time>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO8601>"
}
```

The reusable workflow passes `APP_VERSION` and `APP_REVISION` as docker
build-args, so the app's Dockerfile must declare them and pass them to
the runtime as ENV:

```dockerfile
ARG APP_VERSION=unknown
ARG APP_REVISION=unknown
ENV APP_VERSION=$APP_VERSION \
    APP_REVISION=$APP_REVISION
```

**Why `--resolve` is in the verify step** — public DNS for
`*.innovspatial.app` resolves to Contabo's public IP, where the
`DOCKER-USER` iptables chain DROPs non-Tailscale, non-office source
IPs. The GHA runner connects to Tailscale (`tag:ci`) but its public
egress is its own GitHub-hosted IP, not its Tailscale IP. Forcing
curl to dial Contabo's Tailscale IP (`100.83.140.7`) while keeping
the original Host header bypasses the public-DNS path: Traefik routes
by Host header, the cert validates by SNI, DOCKER-USER allows the
Tailscale source.
